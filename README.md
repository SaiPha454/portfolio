## About the Project

This portfolio website was built using **Next.js**, a React framework known for its performance and SEO optimization capabilities. I used **Static Site Generation (SSG)** to ensure fast load times and optimized performance, which is particularly beneficial for a portfolio site. The styling is done with **SCSS**, providing modular and maintainable styles for each section of the site.

The website consists of four main sections:
1. **Home** - A brief introduction and welcome message.
2. **Skills** - A list of my technical skills and proficiencies.
3. **Education** - My educational background and relevant academic achievements.
4. **Projects** - Showcases some of my recent work, including links and descriptions.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: Used for building and optimizing the React-based static site.
- **React**: Frontend framework for creating interactive user interfaces.
- **SCSS**: CSS preprocessor for styling, allowing for better organization and reusable style components.

## Features

- **Static Site Generation (SSG)**: Enhances performance by pre-rendering pages at build time.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures the site is accessible and looks good on all devices.
- **Clean and Modern UI**: Simple, visually appealing design for a professional online presence.
- **Modular Codebase**: Uses Next.js and SCSS to create a maintainable, component-based code structure.
